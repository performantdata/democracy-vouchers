# Democracy voucher test implementation
## introduction

The civic project that this code implements goes by different names:
"Democracy Vouchers" (as implemented by [Seattle][Seattle_Democracy_Vouchers]) or
"Democracy Dollars" (as implemented by [Oakland][Oakland_Democracy_Dollars]).
You can read more about it on [Wikipedia][Wikipedia_Democracy_voucher].

The purpose of this project is to implement a testbed for ideas for the City of Oakland project,
with the hope of making something useful for future governments' democracy voucher programs.
A primary goal of Oakland's project is to introduce digital vouchers,
vis-Ã -vis Seattle's program, which focused on physical vouchers.
Digital vouchers have the promise of making the system cheaper to implement and manage
but also introduce new security considerations.

## building the application

This software runs as a Docker application,
so it requires [a Docker Desktop or Docker Engine environment][Docker-install] in order to run;
this also installs the Docker command-line tool, which is required for building the application's Docker images.

It also [requires sbt][sbt-setup] for running the build scripts.
With <code>sbt</code> installed, you can run
```shell
sbt dockerBuild
```
in this directory to build the Docker images.

## running the application

The Docker images for the application need to first be built, as above.
To run the application see [docker/README.md](docker/README.md).

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that publishes the **static site content** to GitHub Pages.
These pages may not be fully functional without the back-end services, of course,
but it provides a quick way to share that part of the system.

## developing the application

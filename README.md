# Democracy voucher test implementation
## introduction

The civic project that this code implements goes by different names:
"Democracy Vouchers" (as implemented by [Seattle][Seattle_Democracy_Vouchers]) or
"Democracy Dollars" (as implemented by [Oakland][Oakland_Democracy_Dollars]).
You can read more about it on [Wikipedia][Wikipedia_Democracy_voucher].

The purpose of this project is to implement a testbed for ideas for the City of Oakland project,
with the hope of making something useful for future governments' democracy voucher programs.
A primary goal of Oakland's project is to introduce digital vouchers,
vis-Ã -vis Seattle's program, which focused on physical vouchers.
Digital vouchers have the promise of making the system cheaper to implement and manage
but also introduce new security considerations.
